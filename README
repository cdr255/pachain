Pachen - the Pathfinder Character Encarnator. A simple CLI script
meant to make creating pathfinder characters a quick and (relatively)
painless process, allowing You to focus on the fluff instead of the
crunch.

Going into this, I realize that it will be fairly limited in its
approach. This is meant to expediate the process, and will help to
quickly create fairly basic characters. Those who know how to create
characters well (and have the time to do so) shouldn't really need to
use this utility at all.
